    "### Synopsis\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tiny Portraits* is an annotated face image dataset sourced from the \n",
    "well-known *CelebA* dataset that has been utilized in thousands of papers.  We\n",
    "rendered smaller images (of size 108 x 84 pixels), and consider only a subset of the \n",
    "data and attributes, so meaningful experiments can be conducted also in the absence of \n",
    "GPU acceleration.  (If you have access to GPUs, by all means feel free to use them in \n",
    "your exploration.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the images may look similar, please note that *Tiny Portraits* is not just \n",
    "a re-rendering of the 'aligned' version of the original data, but was created \n",
    "independently.  Similarly, attribute labels have been processed directly from the\n",
    "original annotation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation:  Unpacking images\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not done so yet, please unpack the image archives first.<br>\n",
    "A simple tool to do this is included in the repository:\n",
    "[Unpacking notebook](./Tiny%20Portraits%20-%20Unpack%20Thumbnail%20Images.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a notebook designed to give an overview of the dataset, and demonstrates\n",
    "a default way to access image and attribute information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Present random examples (images and attributes)\n",
    "* Create randomized 'wallpapers' displaying a mosaic of faces\n",

    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested to learn how you investigate a set of data and build useful\n",
    "computer vision tools on it.  Critical thinking is most welcome, as is showcasing\n",
    "your coding capabilities and knowledge of Deep Learning/Computer Vision algorithms\n",
    "and packages.  Communication is an important aspect of the job, so please explain\n",
    "your reasoning and the approaches you choose, and illustrate your findings and\n",
    "limitations.  We will give you a lot of leeway in how you tackle the challenge,\n",
    "but here are some topics you should consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset properties**<br>\n",
    "  Examine the peculiar qualiities of this dataset - is it balanced? \n",
    "  are there outliers? etc.\n",
    "* **Gender classifier**<br>\n",
    "  Build a classifier algorithm that learns to assign a gender attribute to a\n",
    "  face image.  How well does this work?  Does it generalise to other portraits?\n",
    "* **Hair colour classifier**<br>\n",
    "  How do you have to change the gender detection model to predict hair colour?\n",
    "  What remains the same?  What is now different?\n",
    "* **A fairness problem**<br>\n",
    "  In many applications, one wants to learn one attribute from data (here, the \n",
    "  hair colour) without discriminating a 'protected' attribute (here, gender).\n",
    "  In other words, we are looking for a model that for a given sample, can find other \n",
    "  samples with similar hair colour without regard to the gender of the sample.\n",
    "  Discuss to which degree this may be possible.  Is your hair colour model \n",
    "  gender-biased?  Based on your ideas, tweak your model to remove or reduce this bias.\n",
    "* **Portraits from scratch**<br>\n",
    "  Sketch how you would build and train a model that can create face thumbnails\n",
    "  'from scratch' starting from the *Tiny Portraits* dataset.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### How your solution will be evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "We already touched this above, but let us summarize the rubrics we're interested in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Code quality**<br>\n",
    "  Is your code correct?  Is it efficient?  Is it easy to follow?\n",
    "  Does it lend itself to sharing?<br>\n",
    "  (*Note*: For your solution, feel free to use the standard computer vision/deep \n",
    "  learning/data science frameworks, i.e., modules like `PIL`/`Pillow`, `OpenCV`, \n",
    "  `Tensorflow`, `Pytorch`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.)\n",
    "* **Novelty of solution**<br>\n",
    "  How interesting is your solution?  How well does it fit the problem at hand?\n",
    "* **Scientific quality**<br>\n",
    "  Is your solution *ad hoc*, or based on overarching principles of machine learning?\n",
    "  Why did you select it?  How well does it perform?  What further steps would you take next?\n",
    "* **Sharing of insights**<br>\n",
    "  Are you able to convey your ideas?  Do you clearly present your findings?"
